DESCRIPTION OF RANDOMNESS IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF RANDOMNESS
FOR EXTRA CREDIT:
For both random cut and random shuffle, the programm will choose a number between 1~6 randomly. Then it will use that number as
variation to perform cutting and shuffling. 
Also, since I use random_device which can generate real random number and the result should be different everytime 
running the program. 
The reason why I choose number between 1~6 because when we do those action in reality especially shuffling, the difference between 
each cluster should be too large assuming that "person" is proficient on those action.
